Description :
=============
I just shared my works, which I worked as learning path and practiced some C programming such as array, pointers, preprocessor, string, bit operations, data scope, dynamic memory, functions, structures, command line arguments, get input and display the output and variable arguments. In Data structures, some C Programs with Design and implementation of ordered and unordered Single Linked list, Double Linked List, Queue and Stack. 

Projects, using C programing, are included with Design, development, implemented and tested, are as follows :
=============================================================================================================
1: Big number basic arithmetic calculator with operations of addition, subraction, division, multiplication and modulation.
2: Employee's Record using EmpID based Double Linked List.
3: Employee's Record using EmpID based Single Linked List.
4: Determine the maximum number of Powerpuff Girls which will be created with the current quantity of ingredients.
5: Calculate and display range of prime numbers.
6: Implementation of scanf and printf function.
7: Movement of elevator's car cabin controller.
8: Diagonal Difference - Given a square matrix of size , calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals. 

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I just shared my works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files and some programming that might not being implement, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. Purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for learning and educational purpose only. It can be used as the open source and/or freeware. Kindly read the LICENSE.txt for license, terms and conditions about the use of source codes, binaries, documentation and all other files, located in all my repositories. 

Autography :
============
I, K.M. Arun Kumar alias Arunkumar Murugeswaran, in the year 2003, graduated (B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering (EIE) at Government College of Technology (GCT), Coimbatore, India), was a C developer, with 2 years of work experience (2003-2005) at a company, based in Chennai, India, as a network programmer (using C programming language), in a role of Software engineer in Design & Development Team, in domain of Remote Access Server (RAS). I resigned from that company, due to work stress that I was unable to bear, which affected my health and then treatment given by a doctor, which was not suitable for my health, worsen my health. After a rehabitation process in my health, thanks to my mother, sister and family, healthcare, myself, god and all those who directly or indirectly helped me and 
my family, which helped me to recover my health. I again practice and refresh C programming.
 
I have a career break from 2005 - present, in 2018-2019, I also learned some Embedded C Programmming using ATMEL AT89C51, PIC16F887, PIC18F4680 and LPC2138 to practice Embedded C programmming and searched for the job. But in vain, mainly due to my career break and my age. 

Till present, I just shared my works that I used as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files. 
       
My Thanks and Tribute :
========================
I thank to all those, for their support or helped, to me and my family. My tribute to my Parents, Sister and Family, Grandparents, Dears, Teachers, Guidance (including GitHub, Toolchains & my reference), Friends, Nation, Farmers, Workers, defense force personnels and their family, those with good spirits, those involve in social service, those contribute in open source and/or freeware, Nature, Jimmy Dog and all those, who directly or indirectly helped me and/or my family. 

Toolchains that I used for C Application design and development are as follows :
==================================================================================
1: IDE or Compiler used                                                     - Dev-C++ or Turbo C++. 
2: Desktop Computer Architecture and OS for C Programming                   - Intel X64 & Windows 7 (32 bit).
3: Code editor                                                              - Notepad++.
